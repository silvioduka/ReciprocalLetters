The reciprocal of a letter is found by flipping the alphabet and taking the letter on the same position. 


For example, Z is the reciprocal of A and vice versa because if you reverse the alphabet, A will be in the position of Z. 

Similarly, T is the reciprocal of G, J is the reciprocal Q. 

   
Create a program that takes an input string and convert it into its reciprocal value. 

The output should preserve the capitalization of the string. 

   
For Example: 

Input: "SoloLearn iS AwesOme" 

Output: "HlolOvzim rH ZdvhLnv"
